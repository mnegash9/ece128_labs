## Lab 9 - Combinational and Sequential Multiplier
In this lab, I designed and implemented two types of multipliers to perform arithmetic operations on an FPGA board. First, I created a Sequential Multiplier to multiply two numbers, writing its Verilog code and testbench, and assigning the appropriate pins in the XDC file for deployment. Next, I designed a Combinational Multiplier to achieve the same functionality, also developing its Verilog code and testbench, followed by proper pin configuration. I programmed both modules onto the FPGA board and displayed their outputs on the segmented display. This lab provided valuable hands-on experience in designing, testing, and implementing digital multipliers, strengthening my skills in hardware description language (HDL) and FPGA programming.
In conclusion, the lab was successful in achieving its objectives. Both the Sequential and Combinational Multipliers were designed, tested, and implemented on the FPGA board as planned. The outputs of the multipliers were accurately displayed on the segmented display, with the input numbers being provided through the board's switches. This demonstrated the functionality and correctness of the designs, validating the overall implementation process.
