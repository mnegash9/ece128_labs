In this lab, we are designing SR latches, SR flipflops, D Latches, D Flipflops (synchronous and asynchronous), Toggle Flipflops (TFF), and using TFFâ€™s make a 3 bit counter, and clock divider. 
We are writing this all in Verilog, and the main demonstration mechanism is using a testbench to show that the components designed work as expected.
Included in this file are the source files and testbench for all files.
